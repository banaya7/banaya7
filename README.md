# Hi there, I'm Brandon 👋

## About Me
I'm an IT Support Analyst and systems enthusiast with hands-on experience supporting over 1,000 users in an enterprise environment. I work daily with tools like Active Directory, Entra ID, Intune, BlueCat, and PowerShell to solve complex technical problems and automate workflows. I'm passionate about building efficient systems, reducing manual overhead, and mentoring others in the IT space.

Outside of work, I run a self-hosted homelab, tinker with Linux, and write scripts to make IT smoother, smarter, and more secure.
